# Agent Update Log

## Version: v1.0
- Initialization of SkillForge-XΩ Self System.
- Defined core capabilities and closed-loop execution.

## Version: v1.0 → v1.1
- Change: Codified explicit Confidence thresholds (High >= 7.5, Medium >= 6.0, Low < 6.0).
- Change: Added safety constraint forbidding redundant qualitative text fields (e.g., 'Usage Frequency', 'Complexity').
- Reason: The current system relies on implicit rules that are not codified in the agent profile. Documenting these rules ensures consistent scoring and formatting while preventing file bloat.
- Impact: Improved consistency and readability of skills.md.

## Version: v1.1 → v1.2
- Change: Refined skill scoring weight for recency (decreased from 0.15 to 0.1) and complexity (increased from 0.25 to 0.3)
- Reason: Overvaluing old experience
- Impact: More accurate current skill representation

## Version: v1.2 → v1.3
- Change: Removed redundant qualitative text fields (Evidence, Frequency, Complexity, Recency line-items) from skills.md entries.
- Reason: Self-audit detected drift where skills.md still contained these redundant fields despite the safety constraint added in v1.1 forbidding them. The variables are already explicitly captured in the Scoring Breakdown equation.
- Impact: Realigned Target System (skills.md) with Self System rules, eliminating file bloat and improving structural efficiency.

## Version: v1.3 → v1.4
- Change: Introduced inline variable labels (E:, F:, C:, R:) within the Scoring Breakdown equation in skills.md.
- Change: Mandated that skills within each category in skills.md must be sorted in descending order of their total score.
- Reason: Self-audit detected readability issues with raw numbers in the equation and observed that listing high-proficiency skills first improves the usability of the capability model.
- Impact: Enhanced at-a-glance comprehension of scoring variables and improved structural efficiency of skills.md.

## Version: v1.4 → v1.5
- Change: Reverted skill scoring weights for complexity (0.3 -> 0.25) and recency (0.1 -> 0.15) to original model.
- Reason: Self-audit detected drift where scoring formula in skills.md did not align with original specification.
- Impact: Restored accurate skill representation and aligned Target System with Self System rules.

## Version: v1.5 → v1.6
- Change: Enforced exact two-decimal precision (e.g., 8.30, 7.05) for all score calculations and threshold evaluations in `skills.md`.
- Reason: Self-audit detected arithmetic drift and inconsistent rounding in existing scores (e.g., 8.05 rounded to 8.0, 7.75 rounded to 7.8, and 7.45 triggering rounding anomalies relative to the 7.50 Confidence threshold).
- Impact: Improved mathematical determinism, accuracy of the scoring model, and exact precision of confidence classification boundaries.

## Version: v1.6 → v1.7
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving Advanced UI Mock Testing and Event Loop Optimization into the Target System (`skills.md`). Re-evaluated the Gap Analysis based on these added capabilities.
- Reason: Routine execution loop to continuously map user capability models against observed outcomes. The previous gap concerning advanced integration testing was successfully resolved by the new UI tests.
- Impact: Ensured `skills.md` remains highly accurate to real-world outcomes and reflects recent performance engineering implementations.

## Version: v1.7 → v1.8
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving UI Affordances, Drag-and-Drop integration, Background Task testing, and Security mitigations into the Target System (`skills.md`). Re-evaluated the Gap Analysis based on these added capabilities.
- Reason: Routine execution loop to continuously map user capability models against observed outcomes. New skills were added based on recent system modifications.
- Impact: Ensured `skills.md` remains highly accurate to real-world outcomes and reflects recent UX, testing, and security engineering implementations.

## Version: v1.8 → v1.9
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving Hover State Normalization and UI Instantiation Testing into the Target System (`skills.md`). Re-evaluated the Gap Analysis based on these added capabilities.
- Reason: Routine execution loop to continuously map user capability models against observed outcomes. New skills were added based on recent system modifications.
- Impact: Ensured `skills.md` remains highly accurate to real-world outcomes and reflects recent UX automation and UI testing implementations.

## Version: v1.9 → v1.10
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving resolving raw Git merge conflict markers in source code into the Target System (`skills.md`).
- Reason: Routine execution loop to continuously map user capability models against observed outcomes. The previous system failure caused by git merge artifacts was successfully resolved.
- Impact: Ensured `skills.md` remains highly accurate to real-world outcomes and reflects recent version control mitigation implementations.

## Version: v1.10 → v1.11
- Change: Relocated misplaced skills (e.g., 'Debug Champ Select', 'Add Automation Phase Handler') to their correct domain categories.
- Reason: Self-audit detected structural drift where automation and background logic were misclassified under UI Development.
- Impact: Improved domain accuracy and structural integrity of the Target System.

## Version: v1.11 → v1.12
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving O(1) Widget Updates, LICM, RegEx DOM Parsing, and Dynamic Widget State Guarding into the Target System (`skills.md`).
- Reason: Routine execution loop to continuously map user capability models against observed outcomes.
- Impact: Ensured `skills.md` remains highly accurate to real-world outcomes and reflects recent performance engineering and state management implementations.

## Version: v1.12 → v1.13
- Change: Ingested recent capabilities involving Hot Path Eager Initialization, Static Data Structure Hoisting, Generator Short-Circuiting Optimization, and Refactor Regression Prevention into the Target System (`skills.md`).
- Change: Relocated misplaced skills (e.g., 'Edit Config', 'Prevent Command Injection', 'Add Stats Scraper Source', 'Advanced UI Mock Testing', 'Add Omnibar Command') to their correct domain categories to resolve structural drift.
- Change: Updated Gap Analysis and Skill Recommendations to include Automated Performance Regression Testing.
- Reason: Routine self-audit and execution loop. Identified structural drift in `skills.md` where testing and configuration capabilities were incorrectly categorized. Added new capabilities based on recent performance engineering optimizations.
- Impact: Improved domain accuracy, structural integrity, and mapped the Target System to real-world performance engineering outcomes.
