2. Run the installer and launch **LeagueLoop**.
3. **Optional:** Adjust the hotkeys inside the settings modal to your preference.

### Building from Source

To construct a new executable instance using the bundled PyInstaller and InnoSetup automation scripts:

```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/Intrusive-Thots/LeagueLoop-Lock.git
cd LeagueLoop-Lock

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Development Server Native
python -m src.core.main
